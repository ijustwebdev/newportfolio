Here's what I hope to make for mobile:

I already know ahead of time that some components of this site are going to be new territory for me but I'm excited to see what kind of solution I can come up with. For example I want the position of the buttons and the text to change depending on viewport and I'm not 100% sure how I'll be handling that or if it's even possible (but surely it is right?). I've also never created a contact form before or a pop-up modal before though I think I have a pretty good idea of how that is structured already so I'm not anticipating it will slow me down much. 

Already had a catastrophic hardware failure that killed two of my drives I didn't have a backup for.
